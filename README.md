# DL_final_project_object_detection

This is the final project for the Deep Learning course offered by the University of Toronto, School of Continuous Study. 
I am working on building a Faster RCNN model to do object detection on a very simple data of images involving three fruits: banana, apple, and orange.
The base model used is VGG-16.
